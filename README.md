# DaPINN
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely applied in different fields due to their effectiveness in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs need to be considerably improved for scientific and commercial use. To address this issue, we systematically propose a novel dimension-augmented physics-informed neural network (DaPINN), which simultaneously and significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the PINN.
